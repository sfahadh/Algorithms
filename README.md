# Algorithms
A series of data structure related problems to help those new to linked list, tree and graph data structure. Each problem includes a description of the problem, test cases to check whether a correct solution of the problem was given or not, and solutions to the problem if all hope seems lost when trying to solve the problem.

## Linked List Topics
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List
- Circular Linked List

## Tree Topics
- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Binary Tree
- Nary
- Heap
- Trie

## Graph Topics	
- Directed Graph
- Undirected Graph
- Weighted Graph
- Unweighted Graph
- Cyclic Graph
- Acyclic Graph

## Algorithm Topics
* Binary Search
* Depth First Search (DFS)
  * Pre-Order
  * In-Order
  * Post-Order
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
  * Level-Order
* Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Node Insertion
* Node Creation
* Node Deletion

## How to get started
From your terminal <br/>
_Clone this repo_

```
 git clone https://github.com/sfahadh/algorithms.git
 cd algorithms
```

_Solve one of the problems in the problem.js file and then run the following command_ <br/>
Note: update the test file in the package.json file

```
npm run test
```

If you passed all test cases, Congratulations! You can move on to the next problem set, if not try again.
